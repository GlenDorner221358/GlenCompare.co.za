# ABOUT THE PROJECT

Welcome to glencompare! This project compares the stats of 2 different pokemon using the open API called pokeAPI and displays them on on easy to understand charts using chartjs!

This project was built using React, Chartjs, bootstrap, axios and react-routing! And of course, the pokeAPI...


## GETTING STARTED

### Prerequisites

First of all, these files do not have the 'node_modules' file included, you are going to have to use your own.

For this project to work you are going to have to install these dependencies (React-routing, Bootstrap, Chartjs, chartjs2 and axios).

### How to install

1. Download and open the project files.
2. Create a new react app (npx create-react-app 'name') (this will install the node_modules file)
3. Navigate into the project directory (cd 'name')
4. Install all dependencies (npm i 'dependency')
5. Run npm start


## FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

Using this website you can:
1. Compare the stats of 2 different pokemon (any pokemon)
2. See how many things were introduced in each gen on the timeline page.


## CONCEPT PROCESS

### Ideation

I chose the pokeAPI as my api of choice as I am very familiar with the pokemon games and the data you can pull from them. From the stat I wanted this website to be about comparing 2 pokemon.

### Wireframes

The wireframes are located in the repo itself but if you dont want to download and view them there, here they are

### Custom UI

The brief for this part was not very specific, so for my custom UI elements I added some bootstrap cards at the bottom of my Landing page describing some functions of the website.


## DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

### Implementation process

#### Highlights

* The biggest thing I want to highlight is how much chatgpt sped up the coding process.
* The compare page updates as you type, not all at once.
* A really cool feature I added was displaying the sprites of the pokemon you are comparing. I feel this adds a nice visual aspect to help you when comparing.

#### Challenges

* When importing some code from chatgpt, it forgets the main chartjs auto import that makes the charts actually display. Took me a while to figure that out.
* React also does not have error messages for dependencies or some syntax errors, so sometimes when I messed up code I just wouldn't know what was wrong.
* Some of the css was also a challenge because of the component based nature of react.
* For the charts on the compare page, because of the nature of pokemon you cant really display a chart that will apply to EVERY pokemon *except for the base stats*. Every pokemon has base stats.


## FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION

Some functionality I would like to add to this website is displaying more varied data for the compare page, like moves you can learn in each gen, and type advantages.


## FINAL OUTCOME

## CONCLUSION

This project was a lot of fun compared to last year. Chatgpt really sped up the process, and the coding we were doing this term seemed to be more basic and understandable.
